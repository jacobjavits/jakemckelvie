For what seems like an eternity, I have been in search of the perfect solution for my email management. I sometimes fall victim to the notion that I just need to find the one perfect app to bundle my productivity tools and then my work life will be smooth sailing henceforth. I know that's dumb, but what are you gonna do?

My frustration with email, though, is that it just doesn't seem like it should be that difficult to have a decent workflow. I manage three email accounts: one for my personal/work stuff, one for my band, and one for a company I do some contract work for. All three of these were Gmail/Google Apps addresses until recently. I moved my personal account over to [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/) as I've decided to try to get away from Gmail, at least for accounts that I control. My only aim is to be able to manage all three of these accounts from a single app/interface, but the caveat is that I don't want to succumb to the generally unsavory privacy practices of most third-party email clients.

I had been using the popular Spark app for Mac until I discovered that their privacy policy [left a lot to be desired](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/5grsan/do_not_use_the_spark_email_client_by_readdle/). That left me to dive back into the "best mac email client 2018" Google searches that just yield a bunch of different lists of the same apps in a slightly different order. Apparently the majority of third-party mail clients (at least that I'm aware of) at the very least store your credentials on their own servers. Historically, I've not been super paranoid about things like that, but I feel like we're at a point collectively where perhaps a little more thought should be put into these things, so I'm doing my best to be thoughtful about it.

At the time of writing this, I've switched back to the default Mail app for Mac and iOS. It gets the job done, but still has some clunky features that are a little annoying to me. I guess I just wonder if I'm overthinking it and being too picky, or if this is a problem that other people face too. It's ultimately not the end of the world, it's just something that I find myself scratching my head about a little too often.
